# General Design

## ToDo:
* Populate list of popular people(/creatures/things)
    * Search for an API to make this data. Then store locally:
        * Gender
        * Name
        * Reason why famous
        * Short bio
        * Images
    * Store people in database
* Figure out what criteria to populate on:
    * Hello world for first iteration
        * Respond with 3 people
        * Rerun button
    * Possible second iteration
        * Take user's choices for data analytics
        * Track user requests
        * Populate people based on specific criteria
* Make a single JSP front-end
    * Simple form to kick off request (button ONLY)
    * Show response on webpage
* Host this
